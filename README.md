App architecture is inspired by Android proposed app architecture and the MVVM model.

This app has following packages:

1.  **data**: Contains static geodata.
2.  **di**: Dependency providing classes using Hilt.
3.  **db**: Database classes.
4.  **web**: Classes that deal with fetching, parsing and storing web data.
5.  **model**: Model classes used internally by the app to store data.
6.  **map**:  Classes that handle the transformations related to the map presentation
7.  **repositories**: Contains the Repository class
8.  **map**: Handles the mapbox map 

Technologies used:
- **Mapbox** to rendering and displaying the data as a live map
- **Kotlin Coroutines** to handle async code in a seamless way
- **Hilt** for dependency injection
- **LiveData** to update UI components
- **Room** to store air quality data
- **Retrofit** for api calls

Future additions:
- More unit tests
- Add more info to the map to improve UX
